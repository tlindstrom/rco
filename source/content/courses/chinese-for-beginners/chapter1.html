    <p>Unlike in English, we do not make changes on words for tenses, plurality or cases. This is why some people say that Chinese has no grammar. In Chinese,  '他' can be ‘he’ or ‘him’ in English. When it comes to plural forms, we simply attached 們 (men) to the pronouns we want to pluralize. Therefore, the plural forms of the pronouns in the above are as in the following:</p>

    <table class="table">
        <tr>
            <td>我們</td>
            <td>we, us</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>你們</td>
            <td>you (plural)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>您們</td>
            <td>you (plural, respectful form)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>他們</td>
            <td>they, them (masculine)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>她們</td>
            <td>they, them (feminine)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>它們</td>
            <td>they, them (for non-living objects)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>牠們</td>
            <td>they, them (for animals)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>As you can see, Chinese does have grammar, but just appears in a different form.</p>

    <h2>Word Order in Chinese</h2>
    <p>The basic word order in Chinese is Subject + Predicate. A predicate is usually a verb, an adjective or a noun phrase. For example:</p>

    <table class="table">
        <tr>
            <th>Subject</th>
            <th>Predicate</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>我 (I)</td>
            <td>愛 (to love) 你 (you)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>你 (You)</td>
            <td>吃 (to go to) 飯 (rice)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>它們 (They)</td>
            <td>是 (to be) 玩具 (toy)</td>
        </tr>                        
        <tr>
            <td>他(He)</td>
            <td>很 (very) 醜 (ugly)</td>
        </tr>                                                   　　　
        <tr>
            <td>她(She)</td>
            <td>不(not) 美(beautiful)</td>
        </tr>                                                   　　　
        <tr>
            <td>昨天 (Yesterday)</td>
            <td>中秋節 (mid-autumn Festival)</td>
        </tr>                                                   　　　
                        　　　
        <tr>
            <td>我(I)</td>
            <td>三十歲 (thirty years old)</td>
        </tr> 
    </table>

    <p>Note that changing orders of words in a sentence results in a change of meaning. For example, 我愛你(wǒ ài nǐ), which means _I love you_, while 你愛我 (nǐ ài wǒ) means _you love me_.</p>


    <h2>是 (to be)</h2>

    <p>In general, 是 (shì) is used to introduce a predicative which is used to give further explanation or description of a topic. Unlike to be in English, 是 (shì) can only be followed by a noun/pronoun phrase. Therefore, 是 (shì) can function as the verb to be as in she is a girl but not she is beautiful or she is there. In other words, 是 (shì) is used to connect two nouns/pronouns as in the following:</p>

    <p>
    小籠包是上海菜。<br>
    Xiaolongbao is a Shanghainese dish.
    </p>

    <p>
    他是華人。<br>
    He is a Chinese.
    </p>

    <p>
    她是我的姐姐。<br>
    She is my sister.
    </p>

    <p>
    這個杯是我的禮物。<br>
    The cup is my gift.
    </p>

    <p>
    你是壞人。<br>
    You are a bad person.
    </p>

    <p>To negate 是 (shì), we simply put the negator 不 (bù) before it. For example:</p>

    <p>
    他不是華人。<br>
    He is not a Chinese.
    </p>

    <p>
    她不是我的姐姐。<br>
    She is not my sister.
    </p>

    <p>
    你不是壞人。<br>
    You are not a bad person.
    </p>

    <p>At this level, you only need to learn the usage of 是 as ‘to be’. As you proceed to a higher level, you will understand 是 is more than just ‘to be’. To learn more about the comprehensive usage of 是, please click [here].</p>
