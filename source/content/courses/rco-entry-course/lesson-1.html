    <h1>Chapter 1 - Welcome to RCO</h1>

    <p>Hello! Welcome to Read Chinese Online.</p>
        
    <p>This introductory course will teach you the fundamentals of Mandarin Chinese grammar and vocabulary. You can go from being an absolute beginner to having the steady foothold needed to explore the vast world of Chinese reading materials.</p>

    <p>It will also teach you how to use Read Chinese Online as a learning tool.</p>

    <p>Let's get started!</p>

    <h2>How to Use RCO</h2>

    <p>The Chinese word for I is <span data-word="" data-meaning="I" data-pinyin="wǒ">我</span>. Notice how you can hover your mouse pointer over it to show its meaning,and also its pronunciation. If you left-click words, it will take you to the the word's word page, which contains detailed information and example sentences. You can also right-click it for a dropdown-menu where you can choose to listen to its pronunciation.</p>

    <p>Now, let's check out our first Chinese sentence:</p>

    <div class="example-sentence">
        <span data-sentence="" class="chinese chinese-sentence">
            <span class="inner">
                <span data-word="" data-meaning="I" data-pinyin="wǒ">我</span>
                <span data-word="" data-meaning="like" data-pinyin="xǐhuān">喜歡</span>
                <span data-word="" data-meaning="you" data-pinyin="nǐ">你</span>
                <span data-word="" data-meaning="" data-pinyin="。">。</span>
            </span>
        </span>
        <div class="pinyin">Wǒ xǐhuān nǐ.</div>
        <div class="meaning">I like you.</div>
    </div>
        
    <p>Try right-clicking the sentence above. Notice how you can choose to listen to just one word, or the entire sentence. Chinese pronunciation isn't easy, so it's a good idea to listen both to how the separate words, and the full sentence, are pronounced.</p>
    
    <h2>Traditional and Simplified Chinese</h2>

    <p>As you might be aware, written Chinese comes in two variants, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese. Simplified is used in mainland China and Singapore, while Hong Kong and Taiwan use the traditional characters.</p>

    <p>Good news though - no matter which is your preferred script, we've got you covered! Read Chinese Online can be viewed using either traditional or simplified characters. At the top right corner of the page you can select which script you want to use. And you flip it back and forth, if you're curious as to how a particular page will look different in traditional and simplified!</p>

    <h2>Parallel Texts</h2>

    <p>Once you’ve established your foothold, Read Chinese Online also provides you with a collection of parallel texts. These texts have a full Chinese text on the left side of the page and its English translation on the right side. When you hover your mouse point over a Chinese sentence, it highlights the English counterpart, so you don't lose track of where you are in the text. And just like on any other page,you can right click to listen to the pronunciation of words and sentences.</p>

    <table class="ptext">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <span data-sentence="" class="chinese chinese-sentence">

                </span>  
            </td>
            <td>
                <span>I like you.</span>
                <span>Do you like me?</span>
            </td>
        </tr>
        
    </table>
