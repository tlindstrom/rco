    <p>
        We can use 
        <strong>呢 (ne)</strong> to either form a question, indicate that an action is in an on-going state or emphasize a statement. 
        <br/>We use 
        <strong>呢 (ne) </strong> a lot to form a question. Many will link this particle to 
        <a href="/pages/嗎">
            <strong>嗎 (ma)</strong>
        </a> because both are very commonly used for forming questions. I understand it could be quite tempting to mix them up but DON'T! 
        <strong>呢 (ne) </strong> is used to ask follow-up questions, wh-questions and affirmative-negative questions while  
        <strong>嗎 (ma)</strong> is used to ask a different kind of question. For further details of the usage of 
        <strong>嗎 (ma)</strong>, check this out: 
        <a href="/pages/嗎">To Ask Questions with Ma</a>. 
        <br/>Let's have a look at how 
        <strong>呢 (ne)</strong> can be used to form different questions, we would move on to talk about how it is used as a continuous aspect marker and an emphatic particle afterwards.
    </p>

    <h2>To ask follow-up questions as in 
        <em>what about</em> or 
        <em>how about</em> 
    </h2>

    <p>
        <strong>呢 (ne)</strong> is used to follow up what has been said or to bounce back a question, which is very similar to 
        <em>what about</em> or 
        <em>how about</em> in English.
        <br/>It is very simple to use and I guess you might find the following exchanges familiar already:
